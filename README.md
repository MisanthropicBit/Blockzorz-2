Blockzorz 2
===========

A fun and addictive puzzle game inspired by the game `"Tetris Attack" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack>`_ (1995) by Nintendo. Written in C++ with `SDL <http://www.libsdl.org/>`_,
`SDL_image <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/>`_, `SDL_ttf <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/>`_ and `SDL_mixer <https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/>`_.

The game comes with an `easter egg <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29>`_. It also comes with three default highscores to beat. If you have not already beaten them all, take a closer look at the names...

The code is also hosted at `Google code <https://code.google.com/p/blockzorz2/>`_.
