# Blockzorz 2

A fun and addictive puzzle game inspired by the game [`Tetris
Attack`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_Attack) (1995) by Nintendo. Written
in `c++` with [`SDL`](http://www.libsdl.org/),
[`SDL_image`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/),
[`SDL_ttf`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/) and
[`SDL_mixer`](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/).

The game comes with an [easter
egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_%28media%29). It also comes with
three default highscores to beat. If you have not already beaten them all, take
a closer look at the names...
